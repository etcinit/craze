One possible cause of this is if your test-suite builds the library code (see stack <a href='https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1008'>issue #1008</a>). It may also indicate a bug in stack or the hpc program. Please report this issue if you think your coverage report should have meaningful results.</p></body></html>
